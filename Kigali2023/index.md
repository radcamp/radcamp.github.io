# Welcome to RADCamp 2023 - The Kigali Edition (ICCB)

July 22-23, 2023  
University of Rwanda  
College of Science and Technology (CST), Former KIST  
Nyarugenge Campus, KN 7 Ave  
Muhabura Block/Building  
Kigali, Rwanda

You can view a [map of the campus here](https://cst.ur.ac.rw/IMG/pdf/ur_nyarugenge_campus_map_eighth_version_.pdf). 

## Arriving at the University
Sessions will take place in the Muhabura Block/Building. There are three gates
to the university. The most convenient gate to enter (and the gate closest to
the Muhabura Block/Building is the Muhabura Gate. Local drivers (if you’re
taking a taxi or the popular boda boda motorbike taxi) refer to this gate as near
“KUBISMA”). 

## Lunch Options,  Water Coolers, Snacks & Coffee
The University of Rwanda’s cafeteria will be serving an affordable lunch buffet
on Saturday and Sunday, with lunch being available from 12-1pm. Please bring
cash (Rwandan francs) to purchase lunch. There will be vegetarian options. The
University will be setting up water coolers outside of the rooms, so we will be
asking attendees to bring their own reusable water bottles. Make sure to bring
one for yourself. Finally - there will be coffee and snacks that people can grab
during break times (attendees should have Rwandan francs for this as well).
