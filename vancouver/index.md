## What is PoreCamp Vancouver?
PoreCamp Vancouver is the sixth edition of the [PoreCamp series](https://porecamp.github.io/), founded by Nick Loman, Matt Loose and Mick Watson in 2015. PoreCamp is a training bootcamp based around Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT)’s [MinION](https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion) sequencing system, a USB-size DNA sequencer which is capable of producing 10-20 Gbase of sequence data with read lengths as high as hundreds of kilobases. One of its key advantages is to produce data in near-real time - the system has been used to monitor the [Ebola outbreak](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v530/n7589/full/nature16996.html) in 2015, the [Zika outbreak](http://zibraproject.github.io/) in 2016, and in July 2016 the MinION became the [first sequencer in space](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/2181.html). The Porecamp instructors recently [sequenced a whole human genome](http://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/NA12878) with this technology.

For the first time, PoreCamp Vancouver will include **two events**:
* a day-long [Highlights workshop](highlights.md), compressing the best of PoreCamp into a single-day experience ([Register now!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/porecamp-vancouver-one-day-highlights-session-registration-friday-may-4-tickets-43071424791))
* a [week-long camp](timetable.md) in the traditional PoreCamp format (this course is now fully subscribed)

The workshops will be a unique opportunity to get hands-on experience in generating and analyzing MinION data from some of the leading experts in the field – [Nick Loman](http://lab.loman.net/), [Josh Quick](http://lab.loman.net/), [Matt Loose](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/life-sciences/people/matt.loose), [John Tyson](http://snutchlab.msl.ubc.ca/labmembers/), [Jared Simpson](http://simpsonlab.github.io/), and [Lauren Cowley](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t2_rH0kAAAAJ&hl=en) will join local hosts [Jennifer Gardy](http://www.spph.ubc.ca/person/jennifer-gardy/), [David Ng](http://popperfont.net/), [Robin Coope](http://www.bcgsc.ca/), and [Steve Pleasance](http://www.bcgsc.ca/) for five days of sequencing, bioinformatics, and general merriment.

## When and where will PoreCamp Vancouver take place?
The one-day Highlights workshop will run all day Friday, May 4, 2018 in Room 102 at the [Michael Smith Laboratories](http://www.msl.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). For more information, visit our [Highlights](highlights.md) page.

The full camp will run all day Monday, May 7 through all day Friday, May 11, 2018. A detailed timetable is available [here](timetable.md). We’ll be based in Room 102 and at the [Advanced Molecular Biology Laboratory (AMBL)](http://www.bioteach.ubc.ca/) at the [Michael Smith Laboratories](http://www.msl.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), with some lunchtime lectures in the new [Centre for Brain Health lecture theatre](https://www.centreforbrainhealth.ca).
